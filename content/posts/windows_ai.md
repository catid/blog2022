## Motivation

These were generated on my Windows 11 PC with a GeForce RTX 2080 card in just 20 seconds:

## Prerequisites

First we need to install the latest drivers and Python environment.

Download and install the latest Nvidia driver here: https://www.nvidia.com/download

Download and install the latest Nvidia CUDA driver here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Download and install Anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

From Anaconda, install "CMD.exe Prompt" and "Jupyter Notebook".

From Anaconda's CMD Prompt, install PyTorch.  The command to run is generated by this website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/  Select Stable, Windows, Pip, Python, latest CUDA.
Copy and paste the command into the prompt window and hit enter.


## Create an SD account

We'll be using the SD model from https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4
There may be a new version at the time you're reading this.

You'll need to create a free account, and verify your Email address.


## Set up Python Notebook

We'll be using the tool software from https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers

Download a copy of the Python notebook from here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb

Save it to your Documents folder.

From Anaconda, Launch the Jupyter Notebook app, and then navigate to the notebook file.

You can then run through each step in order, and they should all complete successfully since we installed the prerequisites.

On my limited desktop GPU, I need to use fp16 precision and can only generate two images at a time.

If I try to generate too many, the Python script fails and leaves the kernel in a bad state where it cannot generate anymore.  To fix it, go to the Kernel menu and select Restart, and then run through again starting from `import torch` script.

# Quick notebook scripts:

```
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

```
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

# make sure you're logged in with `huggingface-cli login`
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", revision="fp16", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_auth_token=True)  

pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

# Work-around a bug: Run it once to reduce memory usage.  This allows us to batch 2 at a time later for some reason.

from torch import autocast

prompt = "victory for humans"
with autocast("cuda"):
    images = pipe(prompt)["sample"]
```

Script to generate a bunch of images in a way that you can preview at lower quality and then re-run your favorites at higher quality:

```
from PIL import Image
from torch import autocast
import os

text_prompt = "anthropomorphic wolf in a trenchcoat"
steps=50 # Start with fewer steps (lower detail) and increase if you like an image to improve quality
# Steps 75 and 100 are both noticeably better jumps in quality
width=512
height=512
seed=18736684 # Starting seed, increased by 1 for each image generated so you can generate each image again
n=50 # Number of image pairs to generate

num_images = 2
prompt = [text_prompt] * num_images

os.mkdir(text_prompt)

for x in range(0, n-1):
    seed = 18736684 + x
    generator = torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(seed)

    with autocast("cuda"):
      images = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=steps, height=height, width=width, generator=generator)["sample"]

    for i, img in enumerate(images):
        img.save("{}/{}_{}.png".format(text_prompt, seed, i))
```
